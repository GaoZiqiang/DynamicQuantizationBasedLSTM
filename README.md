## Introduction
An implement of DYNAMIC QUANTIZATION ON AN LSTM WORD LANGUAGE MODEL by Pytorch.For more details please refer to https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/dynamic_quantization_tutorial.html?highlight=lstm.
## How to make it work
Something you need to do is just prepare the needed dataset:wikitext-2 and a pre-trained model:word_language_model_quantize.pth.
After that,then run "python test.py" and it will get worked.
